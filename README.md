## Synopsis

A Project for Kumparan Entry Test. As instructed, I'm building a single page for tasks and posts management. User must be able to interact with menus and to reply or add new posts.
There is a unit test as well. 

## Installation

npm -install. All dependencies is be listed on package.json


## Tests

run npm test to start unit testing

There are issues with karma tests configurations and nightwatch selenium configurations as well. So in this project I'm still using Mocha for my test framework with no test runner
